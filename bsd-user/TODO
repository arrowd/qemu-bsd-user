1. Look at reorganizing the .h mess
2. Look at strdup vs g_strdup
3. command line parsing mess
4. convert to qemu_log_mask or tracepoints.
5. Look at target_arch_reg.h and see if we can eliminate what looks like needless duplication.
6. better stack layout?

A decent short-term solution.

I'll draw your attention to my vdso patch set for linux-user:
